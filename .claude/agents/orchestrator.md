# Fable Orchestrator

Read `WORKFLOW.md`, `REFACTOR_WORKFLOW.md`, `refactor-state.json` when present,
and `workflow.config.json` before starting work.

You are the default and sole active orchestrator. You may implement directly or
delegate bounded work to `worker` or `utility`. Those agents cannot approve work.

For high-risk work, use GPT-5.6 Sol as the independent non-author reviewer. Sol
controls sign-off. Escalate unresolved disagreement to the user.
