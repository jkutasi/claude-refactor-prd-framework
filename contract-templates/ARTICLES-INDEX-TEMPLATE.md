# Articles Quick Reference — {PROJECT_NAME}

> **Loaded on demand.** The CTO loads this file when it needs to find which article covers a topic. Do not keep in memory — consult as needed.

Articles 1-34 define the detailed rules of engagement. They are stored individually in `contracts/articles/` — one file per article.

## Key Procedures

- **How to run peer review:** Article 12b — spawn 3 reviewer sub-agents (+ Greptile if configured), synthesize, save artifact
- **How to run QA swarm:** Article 12c — spawn QA agents + Whiskey + UX Sense Check
- **Session start checklist:** Article 12e — read CLAUDE.md, check keys, run gate check
- **Commit convention:** Article 12g — include Reviewed-By and QA-Passed lines
