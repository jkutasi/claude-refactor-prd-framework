# Claude Get-Started PRD Framework

A multi-agent project template for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) with [Agent Teams](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/agent-teams). It defines the structure, contracts, QA process, and delivery model for building software with AI agents that orchestrate, code, review, and test — with enforced separation of concerns.

## What This Is

This is a **methodology template**, not a code library. Copy the entire folder into a new project workspace, replace the `{PLACEHOLDER}` values with your project specifics, and Claude Code uses it as its operating contract.

The framework enforces:

- **CTO Orchestrator** (Opus) delegates all work — never writes code directly
- **Test-first workflow** — tests are written by independent agents before any implementation code
- **Multi-model peer review** — every slice reviewed by Gemini, OpenAI 5.5, Opus, and Grok independently (4-model adversarial)
- **Adversarial QA** — Red Team, Professors, Whiskey Team, and UX Sense Check run on every slice
- **10-phase slice lifecycle** (A through J) with mechanical gate checks at each transition

## Quick Start

1. **Copy** this entire folder into your new project workspace
2. **Open** `getting-started/INDEX.md` — it's the sequential roadmap, follow it step by step
3. **Replace** all `{PLACEHOLDER}` values with your project specifics (tech stack, project name, paths, etc.)
4. **Set up** `.env` with API keys for peer review models (Gemini, OpenAI/Codex, Grok/xAI)
5. **Enable** Agent Teams: set `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`
6. **Start** Claude Code — it reads the contracts and operates within them

## Per-Slice Workflow (Phases A–J)

Every vertical slice follows this mandatory sequence:

| Phase | Name | What Happens |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **A** | Preparation | CTO reviews requirements, researcher gathers docs |
| **A.5** | Doc Bootstrap + Diagrams | Slice 0: docs + high-level diagrams. Slices 1+: per-slice diagrams |
| **A.6** | User Scope Confirmation | User reviews and approves slice scope before Red Team and tests |
| **A.7** | Red Team + Professor Pre-Build | Adversarial + domain-expert review of the user-confirmed plan before any code is written |
| **B** | Test Specification | B.1: Gherkin audit. B.2: Test-writer agents write all tests (must be RED). B.3: Test peer review |
| **C** | Implementation | Coder agents write code until all tests from Phase B pass |
| **D** | Self-Reflection | Each coder re-reads their own code as a reviewer |
| **E** | Peer Review | 4 independent external models review in parallel (Gemini, OpenAI 5.5, Opus, Grok) |
| **F** | QA Swarm | Standard QA + Whiskey Team + UX Sense Check in parallel |
| **F.5** | Runtime Log Check | Check Sentry, server logs, DB logs for errors surfaced during QA |
| **G** | Autonomous Fix Verification | Autonomous Defect Resolution Protocol — QA agents fix inline, CTO verifies + handles escalations |
| **H** | Regression | Full regression check + implicit behavior regression (6 categories) |
| **I** | Documentation | Scribe updates all affected docs |
| **I.5** | User Delivery | CTO presents DONE slice to user with all QA results — user only sees fully-vetted work |
| **J** | Gate Check | Mechanical verification that all artifacts exist |
| **Post-Push** | Post-Push Verification | Check error tracker and deployment logs after every push |

## Key Concepts

- **Nuclear Rules**: Nine rules that override everything — CTO never writes code, peer review is mandatory, slices ship complete
- **Operational Workflow (Articles 21-34)**: Git workflow, lint enforcement, sub-agent separation, QA sweep, BFF pattern, observability operations, planning decomposition, error diagnosis
- **Test-First (Articles 17-18)**: Tests are written by independent test-writer agents *before* implementation. Different agents write tests vs. code. Test code also gets 4-model peer review
- **Autonomous Defect Resolution Protocol**: Bug found → finding agent spawns fix sub-agent → AUDIT test → RED (must fail) → GREEN (fix code) → REGRESSION (full suite) → CLASS SCAN (fix all instances of same category) → COMMIT (atomic). Escalate to user only for architectural decisions, infrastructure changes, or 3x failure
- **Skeletal Interfaces**: Architect defines function signatures and class stubs (`raise NotImplementedError`) so test-writers can import cleanly before implementation exists
- **10 Review Artifacts Per Slice**: test-spec, test-review, peer-review, qa-swarm, red-team-pre-build, red-team, professor-pre-build, professor, whiskey-team, ux-sense-check (if frontend)
- **Code Architecture Standards (Article 20)**: Feature-based folder organization (20a), three-layer separation (20b), 150-line file limit (20c), display-only frontend (20d), structured logging (20e), error wrapping with context chaining (20f), P0/P1/P2 test priority (20g), and migration strategy (20h). These structural rules are the primary quality mechanism — when code is small and concerns are isolated, agents work better automatically
